					<h3>Data Fetching and State Management in React + Next.js</h3>
					<p><i>October 22, 2022</i></p>
					<p>I recently built an eCommerce app with the intention of learning the Next.js framework, which I had not
						used extensively before. As I expected (and hoped for), this framework presented a few challenges that
						forced me to creatively problem-solve. I thought I'd share my learnings here!</p>
					<h4>Data Fetching and Next.js</h4>
					<p>My intention for the app was to make as few API calls as possible, gathering data at the outset and then
						manipulating as needed on the client side. Normally this would be a simple useEffect within the Home
						component that would make the API call once (upon initial page load) and then set all data into state for
						use
						throughout the session.</p>
					<p>But since components are pre-rendered in Next.js framework, this data fetch could not actually happen in
						the browser. Instead, the data needs to be fetched at buildtime - before the page is initially loaded! And
						this
						happens differently than it would in a standard React application. With Next.js the data fetch is called
						inside the getStaticProps function, which runs at buildtime. Once that happens, the data is sent back from
						the
						server and captured in an object that is then passed along as props to the Home page (component) for
						rendering.</p>
					<h4>State Management</h4>
					<p>My intention for the app was to make as few API calls as possible, gathering data at the outset and then
						manipulating as needed on the client side. Normally this would be a simple useEffect within the Home
						component that would make the API call once (upon initial page load) and then set all data into state for
						use
						throughout the session.</p>
					<p>It actually took a while to wrap my head around the chain of events happening inside my Next.js app, but
						once I found the solution it was really quite simple! Using a conditional statement, I could evaluate if the
						data existed yet in global state. If so, the page would render that data from state. If not, the page would
						use the props data pulled from DynamoDB when getStaticProps was executed.</p>
